PicSync
=======

Android App to automatically upload photos and videos taken with the devices camera to Google Drive 

Currently this app can:
* Sign into your Google Account using Google Play Services
* Observe changes in the Gallery
* Upload media to Google Drive
* Upload only when charging or on wifi

I had hoped to add more features to the app and release it but I never found the time to finish it. It's been sitting here doing nothing for about 6 months so I though I might as well chuck it on Github :P

Building 
========

Before you can build this app in Eclipse you must import the ActionBarSherlock & Google Play Services Library Projects
