# Privacy Policy


### What we collect

* Anonymous information about your phone such as make, model & version of Android. 

### What we don't collect

* Your name
* Your email address
* Any Access Tokens associated with your account
* Any files from your Google Drive - Files are uploaded straight from your device and do not pass through any of our servers. 

### Security
Security is an issue we take very seriously. All connections between this app and the Google Drive API are over https. Connections to the free trial servers are also over https. Your email address is only ever exchanged with the trial servers once to get a unique api token. On further communication with the trial servers your account will be identified with the api token.

### Changes to Privacy Policy

We may change this privacy policy at any time, however you will be notifed of any changes before you can continue using the app. 


Feel free to get in touch if you have any queries about our privacy policy.
